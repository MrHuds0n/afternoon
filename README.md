**Rhazp** (**R**hazp **ha**s **z**ero **p**unctuation) is a modern, innovative CSS framework written in Stylus.

- **Lightweight**, just 12K compressed.
- **Responsive**, flexbox based layout which resizes nicely on mobile devices.
- **Conservative**, leave Material design behind and embrace depth.
- **Sensible defaults**, easy to use and featureful out of the box.
- **Customiseable**, just change a few variables and get an entirely new theme.

# Installation

```
git pull https://github.com/tanglewooddragons/rhazp.git
cd rhazp
npm install
```

There is a simple build script provided which you can use to quickly compile a new theme. To use it, run `./build.sh path/to/theme`.
